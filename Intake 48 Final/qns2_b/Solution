How do threads communicate with each other? Just write the names of 3 methods.
What are the different ways to create a Thread? Show such ways by java example.

Solution:
Methods: wait(), notify(), notifyAll()

Ways to Create Thread:
    1. Extending Thread class
    2. Implementing Runnable interface

Example:
    // Using Thread class
    class MyThread extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Thread using Thread class");
        }
    }

    // Using Runnable
    class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Thread using Runnable interface");
        }
    }
